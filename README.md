Internship: Virtual Introduction to Al, Data Science, and Statistics

Completed a detailed virtual internship program focusing on Al, data science, and statistics, using General Social Studies and Student Statistics datasets.

Statistics and Data Analysis:

Learned and applied statistical concepts including significance, measurement levels, and empirical rules.

Conducted hypothesis testing for one, two, and multiple variables, utilizing tests such as t- tests, Wilcoxon sign rank tests, ANOVA, and chi-square tests.

Explored the differences between paired and unpaired tests and their applications.

Programming and Tools:

Developed Python programming skills for statistical analysis, creating scripts for binomial tests, Pearson chi-square tests, Student t-tests, and more.

Utilized Google Colab and Jupyter Notebooks for coding and data analysis tasks.

Practical Applications:

Conducted one sample and two sample hypothesis tests including Fisher exact test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Welch t-test.

Performed advanced statistical analysis for three or more variables, such as MANOVA and Friedman tests.

Calculated effect sizes for various statistical tests, understanding their significance in real-world data scenarios.

Outcomes:

Demonstrated the ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical data analysis problems.

Enhanced skills in interpreting and presenting statistical data for decision-making purposes.

Gained a comprehensive understanding of statistical methods and their applications in Al and data science contexts.
